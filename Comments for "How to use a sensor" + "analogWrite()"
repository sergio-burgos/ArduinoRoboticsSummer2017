//Comment for "How to use a sensor": Since Arduino can measure voltage, we're using "analogRead", which returns numbers (values) from 0-1023, to read the conversion of the varying resistance to a varying voltage using the fixed resistor (voltage divider) by adding    "Serial.println(sensorValue)" to the code.

//Comment for "analog write(): Controlling speed or brightness": By creating a condition to reverse the direction of fading if brightness is <= 0 or if brightness is >= 255, that changes the value of "fadeAmount" and affects the brightness formula (brightness = brightness + fadeAmount), we're creating a loop that translates into a fading effect of the LED light. We added a delay of 30 milliseconds to be able to see the dimming effect.
