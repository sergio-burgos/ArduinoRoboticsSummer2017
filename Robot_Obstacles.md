I'm not sure if I created the right program. It does what was asked for the homework, but the logic might not be the right one. I modified the code I hade for the previous excercise and in addition to creating the if condition to make the robot perform the sequence after buttonState was "1" (or when the button was pressed), and added a while loop that would continue for as long as the condition that I define was true, which in this case would always be true since when button is released the value of the variable pushButton goes back to "0". 

*I added another exploration (file) where I get the robot to start/stop when I press the button.
