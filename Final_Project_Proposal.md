## Final Project Proposal

**Description:**

After thinking of different ideas, I remembered a robot I saw last year at AT&T Shape Expo that made me feel like I could never do anything like that. It was a spider-looking robot with many motors that created limbs or legs, and it looked amazing when it started walking. After googling for "Spider Robot," I found many variations of that idea and realized that most people  were using servo motors. Since the last time I did a project with arduino I only worked with DC motors, I wanted to challenge myself to work on a project that would help understand a little more about how servo motors work and what I can do with them. 

I think the logic behind programming with servo motors can be interesting, because it requires coordination and precision. This project would also require finding, printing or creating parts that I could assemble to create a spider-looking structure. I would ideally look for a strong material so I could keep this robot after the class is done. And, if I succeed in this first part of making this robot perform a sequence that really looks like a spider, I would like to either add a distance measuring sensor or create a remote control to turn this into a toy I can play with anytime.
