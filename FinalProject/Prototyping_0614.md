## Prototyping 06/14

I decided to simplify the design I wanted and only have 4 legs for the spider robot. This would allow me to use les servo motors, as well as simplify the process of making the robot move. A friend of mine shared with me a file with the design ready to be laser cutted, so I used it on the CCA laser cut machines. The file is here in case others want to download it ([Robot_Quadruped2v2.dxf.zip](https://github.com/sergio-burgos/ArduinoRoboticsSummer2017/files/1092585/Robot_Quadruped2v2.dxf.zip))

After I got all the pieces ready, I decided to spray paint them to give them a different look. After using the spray paint room upstairs, I realized a made the mistake of not removing a protective layer that the material I used to laser cut the parts had, and I could just peel off the paint. This was frustrating because painting the parts took longer than I expected (because of waiting for it to dry so you can use them later and I still got marks and imperfections), and it was all in vain. Leason learned.
