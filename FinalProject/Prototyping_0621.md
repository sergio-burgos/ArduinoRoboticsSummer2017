## Prototyping 06/21

I finally got the servo shield I ordered from Adafruit and started soldering to get rid of the breadboard I was using before. I have to say doing this was very exciting because it was the first time I worked creating a shield and doing a project with arduino without using a breadboard. I guess it just made it feel for like a real project than just an assignment.

Luis helped me use the soldering machines at school during class and finally got to create the shield I was going to use for my spider robot. Michael also helped me learn how to achieve a more clean and precise soldering work. After being done with the shield, I connected it to my robot to make sure this was working, and I coudln't get it to work. After that class, Sabine shared with me that I was probably missing the shield library, and it turned out I was.
