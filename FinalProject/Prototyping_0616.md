## Prototyping 06/16

After removing all of the paint from tha parts I had ready from last class, I started building the legs of the robot and attaching the servo motors to test with code how they would move. While doing this I realized I was missing the right nuts and bolts, so I had to improvise with the ones I found on the hybrid lab and even using wire to attach the servo motor "horns." After this I ordered nuts, bolts and nylon Hex lock nuts.

Here's a video showing how I made one of the legs work: https://youtu.be/kkIDmBfzg1M
